## About

Newman Dashboard aims to provide a real-time WebUI dashboard which can let you control and view the currently executing as well as the previously executed [newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) runs. This would help you debug and analyze your runs from a single endpoint and notify about any error which might occur during the run.

This project was built during [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5547391014404096) ‚òÄÔ∏è with [Postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs) üöÄ
